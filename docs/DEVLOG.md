- After exploring the Wikidata toolkit, it appears there is a really low bar to entry for access to the DATA that may be a great starting point, and just fast enough to back a performant web app. Major changes are reflexting a change of direction in the data source, and a "v2" to sort out the older models built out of the previous data source.
- [ ] Does the wikimedia foundation have a host/platform which might provide a consistent, faast, and reliable way to both host the backend (which should be essentially stateless) and provide near access to the data. Initial testing suggests that at any given second the query time is between 300-800ms. - but the only way to improve this (given this approach) is outside of this domain.
- [ ] Given the limited number of properties, it may make sense to keep these in local memory (not delegate this to wikimedia), or delegate it, but fetch this on startup (once per period of time, on command, etc) then keep a copy in memory to remove this query and speed up response time.
- [ ] The StatementGroupImpl class has a getBestStatements() method which mentions the StatementRank.ENUM --> given this exists might be something to leveraging in weighting the edges of the graph.
