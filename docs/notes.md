# Notes 

## Todo: 
- [ ] Clarify difference between the process.log and the debug.log more clearly & make sure that there are no opinions omittting key information from being logged, or otherwise to the wrong log. 
- [X] Define the counts function a little more clearly - shouldnt count again if count exists, and make sure that after the count is done it is logged meaningfully as well as committed locally - to not have to do this work many dozen times over. 
- [ ] Hey ya jabroni - since your importing the data line by line starting @ 1, and you have an ID which serializes starting at one, do you think that maybe those two values WILL ALWAYS BE MATCHING AND IT WOULD IDK BE REALLY SILLY TO STORE THAT IN VOLUME 250 MILLION TIMES TWICE WOULDNT IT??!!?!
