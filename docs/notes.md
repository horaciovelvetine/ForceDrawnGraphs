# Notes 

## Todo: 
- [ ] Clarify difference between the process.log and the debug.log more clearly & make sure that there are no opinions omittting key information from being logged, or otherwise to the wrong log. 
- [X] Define the counts function a little more clearly - shouldnt count again if count exists, and make sure that after the count is done it is logged meaningfully as well as committed locally - to not have to do this work many dozen times over.
